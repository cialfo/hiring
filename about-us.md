### Why and What we do?

Cialfo offers an innovative SaaS platform (available on web and mobile) for independent college counsellors, private organizations and high schools to streamline their overseas college application process. It increases the effectiveness by enabling efficient task management, managing communications with their students and parents; and an automated proprietary college shortlisting algorithm.

Cialfo started as a overseas education consultancy in Singapore that streamlined the US and UK college application process for students with a unique combination of online platform solutions and mobile applications, designed by highly experienced veterans of the college admissions process. 100% of Cialfo’s students have been admitted to a college of their choice and 60% of them admitted into top 20 US/UK universities.

Cialfo is on a mission to democratize tertiary education globally and help 1 million students through its platform by 2020.

We are doubling our tech team in Bangalore to help build faster. We are [seed-funded](https://e27.co/singaporean-startup-cialfo-raises-a-pre-series-a-to-help-asia-based-students-enter-uk-and-us-universities-20160810/) and we want to use that to build our technology team.

### How we do?   

So far we have built these tools

1. [Companion](https://cialfo.co/companion) - Our white labeled SaaS offerings to consultants and high schools across Asia. We are building features to stream line the work for consultants by allowing them to create and manage tasks for students, track their progress, schedule meetings, chat with them using our chat interface and keep parents up to date with our SMS and email notifications.

2. [College Shortlist](http://colleges.cialfo.co) - We are on a mission to collate all the information for all the US and UK colleges. Everything a student or a consultant need to make informed decision about applying to a college. We have built Compass&trade; - our shortlisting algorithm. It takes your qualitative data and suggests the colleges that are best fit for you.

3. [Get A Plan for SAT](http://getaplan.sitforsat.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring) - every student who wants to study in the US needs to take [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT). Most of the Asian students have difficulty in preparing for the vocabulary section. So we build Get A Plan (GAP) to make the learning process simple and easy. We build 4 fun word games which you can play and that will help you in memorizing the words in a better way. See the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) coverage [here](http://www.wsj.com/video/can-vocabulary-apps-boost-sat-scores/A979447B-4C98-4459-A3D6-A5AAA8512748.html)
